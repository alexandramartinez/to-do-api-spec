## The use case

You need to create a To-Do app to manage tasks. 

The first step is to design the API Specification. An API specification is usually created using either [RAML](https://raml.org/) or [OAS](https://swagger.io/specification/). However, because you are on a time crunch and are not very familiar with these languages, you decide to use MuleSoft for this.

MuleSoft provides a graphical user interface (GUI) in [Anypoint Platform](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/) to complete this specification using clicks, not code.

## What you learn

Without having to code in RAML/OAS, using the visual UI to click your way through the design, you will learn:

- The basic navigation of Design Center in Anypoint Platform
- How to create a new API specification
- How to create and what is a data type
- How to create and what is a resource
- What is a nested resource
- How to make use of a URI Parameter
- Designing [CRUD](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-crud) resources
- Differences between GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods
- Setting up Query Parameters
- Setting up Request and Response bodies
- Successful status codes (200, 201, 204)
- How to publish an API spec to Anypoint Exchange
- How to verify a published API spec
- How to download the created RAML/OAS specification from Design Center
